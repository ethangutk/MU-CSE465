# Lab 02

# What to DO

We will be going over some example scheme files in class.
I want you to follow along with the solutions to some exercises we do during the 
lecture, and then complete the rest of the exercises on your own. 


Your job is to edit the `.scm` files in this 
repository, implementing the scheme functions indicated by comments in the file. 



To test if you have done everything, type

```
make check
```

Feel free to periodically save & push your work

```
git commit -am "Still working on it!"
git push
```


When all tests pass, and you are sure you have done what was _intended_ in the lab 
(e.g. not just printed the output I test for, but actually implement the functions to compute it!!!)
then you are ready to submit to Canvas. 

```
make submit
```

Then copy the URL of your repo and paste it into the submission page on Canvas.


If you have any questions or issues:
1. **DO NOT** wait until the night before it is due to start (!!!!!!)
2. Reread this, and read the chapter, to make sure you are not asking something that was already addressed. 
3. Search through Piazza to see if anyone has asked the question. 
4. Ask on Piazza - but first make a serious effort to solve it yourself - it is respectful of others to try to solve things on your own before immediately asking for help. 
5. Ask the question on Piazza
6. Make sure to provide _all_ of the relevant information. E.g. what is the output you are getting vs what you expect?
